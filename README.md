How to use this project on windows:

1. Install chocolatey packages https://chocolatey.org/
1. Open a command window with Administrator privileges. In that window, install git with the command ``choco install -y git``
1. When that completes, open another command window. It doesn't need to have special privileges.
1. Navigate to your repositories directory and type the command ``git clone https://github.com/talapus/Raspberry_Illusion.git``

Some things to note

1. After installing choco and git, open your file manager and navigate to Program Files\Git and find the 'git-bash.exe' file. Double click it, then pin it to your toolbar. That's bash, and a small set of the common gnu tools. Tiny UNIX on your desktop!

Python

1. Install python with the command ``choco install -y python``

Atom Editor

1. I highly recommend this free editor for working on your python projects. Install it with ``choco install -y atom``
1. It's a full windows GUI application, like a beefed up notepad.
1. It has built-in syntax color filters and syntax checkers.
1. It's also themeable and the appearance is configurable, if you are into that.
